**Shark Attack Analysis:** Strategic Product Expansion

🦈 **Project Overview**
We are an international protective water sports gear manufacturer looking to diversify our product line. This project analyzes the Global Shark Attack File (GSAF) to identify market opportunities for "Shark-Resistant" equipment. By understanding the demographics, activities, and injury patterns of shark encounters, we aim to develop data-driven safety solutions and tailored marketing campaigns.

🎯 ***Business Cases & Hypotheses**
Our primary goal is to determine the feasibility of expanding into shark-resistant gear. We are testing several hypotheses:

Gender-Specific Protection: Does the high frequency of male-related incidents justify a male-centric product line, or is there an untapped market for female safety gear?

Activity-Based Gear: Beyond surfing, which activities (swimming, diving, wading) require specialized protective equipment?

Anatomical Focus: Can we design gear for specific body parts (e.g., ankle repellents or bite-resistant sleeves) based on common injury patterns?

Marketing Insight: By analyzing "Unprovoked" vs. "Provoked" attacks, we can create awareness campaigns that promote safety without fear-mongering.


💡 **Potential Product Pipeline**
Based on our findings, we intend to explore the development of:

Bite-Resistant Wetsuits: High-durability fabrics designed to minimize tissue damage.

Low-Contrast Gear: Wetsuits and boards designed with colors/patterns that are less visible to sharks (based on GSAF visual theories).

Shark Repellent Ankle Gear: Wearable deterrents for swimmers and waders.

Specialized Boards: Surfing and paddle-boarding equipment with integrated safety features.
